Summary of the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Project

This project implements a simple Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) system using Time-Based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) with Python. The key components include:

1. Secret Key Generation: The system generates a unique secret key for each user, which is crucial for creating and verifying TOTP tokens.

2. Token Generation: Using the secret key, a time-based one-time password (TOTP) is generated. This token typically expires after 30 seconds, enhancing security.

3.Token Verification: The user is prompted to enter the TOTP token. The system verifies the entered token against the expected value generated from the secret key.

4. User Interaction: The project demonstrates a basic user flow where the secret key is displayed, the token is generated, and the user can input the token for validation.

Key Libraries Used:
pyotp: This library handles the generation and verification of TOTP tokens, making the implementation straightforward and secure.

Purpose:
This project serves as a foundational example of implementing 2FA, which is crucial for enhancing security in applications by requiring a second form of authentication beyond just a password.
